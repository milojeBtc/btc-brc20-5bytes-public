# Bitcoin BRC-20 5Bytes

## Overview

This repository provides a streamlined implementation of the Bitcoin BRC-20 protocol, specifically designed for handling 5-byte operations. The project focuses on simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the broader Bitcoin ecosystem while maintaining the core principles of decentralization and security.

## Features

- **Advantages of 5-Byte Standard**: The 5-byte BRC-20 standard offers improved efficiency and scalability compared to previous versions by reducing data overhead. This enables faster transaction processing, lower storage requirements, and better compatibility with lightweight applications.
- **5-Byte Compatibility**: Optimized for operations using the 5-byte standard, enabling efficient and lightweight token transfers.
- **Express Framework**: Built using the Express.js framework for rapid API development and robust backend functionality.
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed for enhanced developer productivity, maintainability, and reduced runtime errors.
- **MongoDB Integration**: A reliable and scalable database for storing and managing transaction data.
- **Unisat API Integration**: Utilizes the Unisat API for seamless interaction with the Bitcoin network, eliminating the need for a local Bitcoin Core instance.
